# Phyloseq_for_microbial_diversity
Pipeline for the analysis of microbial diversity with Phyloseq in R

## Source
This pipeline was created following the manuscript [phyloseq: An R Package for Reproducible Interactive Analysis and Graphics of Microbiome Census Data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061217) and other blogs, including [Phyloseq tutorial](https://vaulot.github.io/tutorials/Phyloseq_tutorial.html) and [phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq)

## Data
The data used for this pipeline was obtained from the project: [Effect of hydrochar from acid hydrolysis on anaerobic digestion of chicken manure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343722012167)
